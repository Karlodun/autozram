# runtime example
pool=2000000  # 2gb RAM, in kb

# after swap created:
pool=1000000  # 1gb RAM, in kb
swap=0 # configured swap device

# after additional drives created:
pool=0  # 0gb RAM, in kb
swap=0  # configured swap device
temp=1  # e.x /tmp/ folder with 500MB max ram
srvupload=2  # e.x. /srv/www/upload with 500MB max ram usage

# no additional drives will be autocreated, since pool is exhausted
